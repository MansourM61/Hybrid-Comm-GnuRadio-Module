# Hybrid-Comm-GnuRadio-Module

A module for simulating a hybrid communication systems using GnuRadio.

This is a project that I was working on late 2019 and early 2020. Unfortunately, I never got the time and chance to finish it. The goal was to create a automatic smart switching system in a Hybrid RF/FSO communication system. The switching event is triggered by the weather quality, communication rate, data loss (BER) in real-time.

Hopefully someone will find it useful.
